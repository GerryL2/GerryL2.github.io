            <h2>What's the reason for Zoos?</h2>
            <p>Though we all love zoos for the main reason of being able to see animals when they are not in the wild<br>
            but it is always important to remember the actual reasons for Zoos and why they are some important. It may<br>
            thought that zoos are keeping animals in captivity and not allowing them to be able to their lives fully in<br>
            natural habitat but zoos are doing do opposite, often being a place where animals can rehabilitate and grow up<br>
            somewhere safer from where they would usually be. For example with animals out in the wild often being in certain<br>
            states where they're species may becoming extinct, a zoo plays a big part in researching them, keeping safe, and<br>
            helping their species to mate more and prolong their species. ALso it is frowned upon by some that people are going<br>
            to the zoos and thought that they may be making the animals feel bad but this too is often not the case. The zoo also<br>
            helps people and their families that come to educate themselves on animals and the money that is generated from them<br>
            is most often used to help raise money for conservation efforts, make the zoo areas better for the animals, and money more<br>
            ways that benefit the animals.
